## Course Description:

Video games are a unique interactive experience created with components spanning many fields of study. Experiences are formed by allowing the player to interact with artistic elements (environment, character, sound, narrative, etc.) and the underlying technology (software, hardware, display, controllers, etc.).

This course focuses on game design principles and how they can shape the player experience. Lectures will focus on these principles and analysis of existing games. Class projects allow students to design, program, and demo their own small games.

CMPTGCS 20C is open to all students interested in creating video games and/or learning about software programming in a video game creation context. Depending on students' programming proficiency, various game engines (Scratch, Unity, or other engines with instructor's approval) can be used for course projects.
